            <h1>summer!</h1>
            <p> i feel the sun's heat absorb into my skin<br><br>
            the smell of hot dogs and hamburgers travel through the summer air<br><br>
            making me want to go to a summer fair <br><br>
            i look up into the clear blue sky, loving every minute that goes by <br><br>
            i feel the grass brush softly against me  <br><br>
            being taken by the summer breeze so i can feel at ease  <br><br>
            the feeling of chlorine water refresh my skin  <br><br>
            and absorb into my summer skin <br><br>
            summer don't go away <br><br>
            i just want to go out and play<br><br>
